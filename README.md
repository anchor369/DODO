LOCALGPT
I want to create a project around this idea:
Idea: Local GPT for your home, as you must have used google home, alexa, siri, and such, I want to use AI integrated local gpt.
The idea is basically there will be a application that he will download on the devices he wants to create a environment around.
As soon as he downloads the application on those devices, he can control any device from any other device connected.
basically based on commands or prompts in human language the AI will interpret the intent and do every task that it can, it should also work as your operator, Basically it will act as a human AI helper that can browse each and every file on the computer, do whatever it is asked to open files, open apps, delete files, write code, or perform any other functions
I am going to use my raspberry pi currently as the main server, and other devices as Client
The communication, has to be done over wifi, amd all the devices connected on the same wifi.
Give me a step wise breakdown of the complete project break it in chunks an dgive the proper flow and tools.
