Setting up Samba to send files across multiple devices over the same network can allow you to share files between different devices like Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS. Below is a step-by-step approach to set up Samba on a Linux server (or any device running a Linux-based OS like Raspberry Pi), and then access those shared files from other devices (like Android or iOS).
Step 1: Install Samba on Linux (Server)

    Install Samba: If Samba is not already installed on your Linux device, you'll need to install it. Open your terminal and type:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin

This will install the necessary Samba packages.

Check if Samba is running: You can check if the Samba service is running using the following command:

sudo systemctl status smbd

If it's not running, start it with:

sudo systemctl start smbd

To enable Samba to start automatically on boot:

    sudo systemctl enable smbd

Step 2: Configure Samba (Sharing a Directory)

    Create a Directory to Share: You’ll need a directory to share with other devices. Create one if you don’t already have one:

mkdir -p /home/username/shared

Replace username with your actual Linux username.

Edit Samba Configuration: Open the Samba configuration file to set up the share.

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Add a Share Definition: Scroll to the end of the file and add the following configuration:

[Shared]
path = /home/username/shared
read only = no
guest ok = yes
force user = username

    [Shared] is the name of the share.

    path is the directory you want to share.

    read only = no allows users to write to the directory.

    guest ok = yes allows guest access (no password required).

    force user = username ensures files are created with the correct permissions.

Save and Exit: After editing the file, save and close it (Ctrl + O, Enter, and Ctrl + X).

Restart Samba Service: Restart Samba to apply the changes.

    sudo systemctl restart smbd

Step 3: Allow Samba Through Firewall

If your device has a firewall enabled, you'll need to allow Samba traffic. Run the following commands:

sudo ufw allow samba

This ensures the necessary ports (137, 138, 139, and 445) are open.
Step 4: Check the Samba Share

    List Shares: You can check if the share is visible using:

smbclient -L localhost

This should show the [Shared] directory.

Access the Share on Your Linux Device: You can test accessing the share locally:

    smbclient //localhost/Shared -U username

    Replace username with your Linux username. You can now use commands like ls, get, and put to interact with the shared folder.

Step 5: Access the Shared Folder from Windows (or Other Devices)

    Find the IP Address of the Linux Device: On the Linux device, find the IP address by running:

    hostname -I

    Note the IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100).

    Access Samba Share from Windows:

        Open File Explorer on your Windows PC.

        In the address bar, type \\<Linux_IP_Address>\Shared (e.g., \\192.168.1.100\Shared).

        You should now see the shared folder. You can drag and drop files between the devices.

Step 6: Access the Share from Android or iOS

On Android:

    Download a file manager app that supports SMB (like CX File Explorer, Solid Explorer, or ES File Explorer).

    Open the app and navigate to the network section.

    Select Add SMB Server or Add Network Location.

    Enter the IP address of your Linux device (e.g., 192.168.1.100), the shared folder name (Shared), and any necessary credentials.

    Once connected, you can browse the shared files and transfer them to/from your Android device.

On iOS:

    Open the Files app.

    Tap on the Browse tab.

    Tap Connect to Server or use a third-party app like FileBrowser or Documents by Readdle.

    Enter the IP address of your Linux device (e.g., smb://192.168.1.100/Shared).

    Browse the files and start transferring as needed.

Step 7: Test File Transfers

    On your Android/iOS device, you should now be able to upload and download files from the shared directory on your Linux device. You can use these file managers to move files between devices.

    For example, on your Android device, open the app, go to the shared folder, and then upload or download files as needed. The same applies to iOS with compatible apps.

Troubleshooting Tips

    Check Permissions: If you're having trouble accessing the share, check the permissions of the shared folder on your Linux device:

sudo chmod 777 /home/username/shared
sudo chown username:username /home/username/shared

Access Control: If you don't want to allow guest access (guest ok = yes), you can require users to authenticate by setting up Samba users with passwords. Add a Samba user like this:

    sudo smbpasswd -a username

    Network Issues: Make sure all devices are on the same network and there are no issues with your router/firewall.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to send files between your Linux, Android, and iOS devices using Samba.

If you're seeing a "File not found" error when trying to access the Samba share from your browser or File Explorer in Windows, there are a few potential issues to troubleshoot. Let’s go step-by-step through some common solutions:
1. Verify the Samba Share is Active

First, ensure that the Samba share is running properly and is accessible from your Linux device:

    On your Linux device, check the active shares:

    sudo smbclient -L localhost -U username

        Replace username with your actual Linux username.

        Ensure that the share (e.g., Shared) is listed. If it’s not listed, there might be an issue with your Samba configuration.

2. Check Your Samba Configuration

Ensure the configuration file /etc/samba/smb.conf is correctly set up. Double-check that the section for the shared directory looks something like this:

[Shared]
path = /home/username/shared
read only = no
guest ok = yes
force user = username

Make sure that:

    The path is pointing to the correct directory.

    The guest ok = yes setting allows guest access (if you don't want to use passwords for access).

    If using a specific username, the force user option should match the correct Linux username.

3. Restart the Samba Service

After modifying the Samba configuration or if you're unsure, restart the Samba services to ensure any changes take effect:

sudo systemctl restart smbd

4. Ensure Network Visibility

    Find the IP Address of the Linux Device:

    Run the following command on your Linux server to get its IP address:

hostname -I

Ensure the IP address is something like 192.168.x.x.

Ping the Linux Server from Windows:

On your Windows machine, open Command Prompt (cmd) and try to ping your Linux device to confirm it's reachable:

    ping 192.168.x.x

    Replace 192.168.x.x with your actual Linux device IP. If the ping doesn’t succeed, it indicates a network issue, and you may need to troubleshoot the network settings.

5. Accessing the Share from Windows

In Windows File Explorer (not the browser), use the following steps:

    Open File Explorer and type the following in the address bar:

    \\192.168.x.x\Shared

        Replace 192.168.x.x with the actual IP address of your Linux device.

        Replace Shared with the name of your shared directory, as defined in your smb.conf.

    Using IP Address in File Explorer: This should open the shared directory.

    If Authentication is Required:

        If your Samba configuration requires a password (i.e., guest ok = no), you'll need to enter your Samba username and password when prompted.

    If you're using a guest share (guest ok = yes), Windows might still prompt you for credentials, but you can leave it blank and just click OK.

6. Check Windows Firewall Settings

Windows Firewall can sometimes block access to SMB shares. Ensure that the firewall on your Windows machine is allowing SMB traffic:

    Open Control Panel and go to System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall.

    On the left, click Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall.

    Scroll down and make sure File and Printer Sharing is allowed.

7. Ensure SMBv1, SMBv2, and SMBv3 are Enabled (on Windows)

Newer versions of Windows might disable SMBv1 by default. If you're using an older Samba setup or a legacy configuration, this can cause issues. To check and enable SMBv1:

    Press Windows + R and type optionalfeatures.exe to open the Windows Features menu.

    Scroll down and check the box for SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support.

    Click OK, then restart your computer.

However, SMBv1 is outdated and not recommended for security reasons. It's better to try to use SMBv2 or SMBv3 if possible.
8. Troubleshooting with Logs

If the problem persists, you can check the Samba logs on your Linux machine for more details:

sudo tail -f /var/log/samba/log.smbd

Look for any error messages when trying to access the share from your Windows machine.
9. Access via Windows Command Prompt (Alternative)

If File Explorer is still giving issues, try accessing the share via the command line in Windows. Open Command Prompt and type:

net use Z: \\192.168.x.x\Shared /user:username

    Replace Z: with any unused drive letter.

    Replace 192.168.x.x with the IP address of the Linux machine.

    Replace Shared with the name of your shared folder.

    Replace username with your Linux Samba username (if authentication is required).

This will map the network drive to the Z: drive on your Windows machine.
Summary of Steps:

    Verify the Samba service is running (sudo systemctl status smbd).

    Double-check the Samba share configuration (/etc/samba/smb.conf).

    Restart the Samba service (sudo systemctl restart smbd).

    Ensure both devices (Linux and Windows) are on the same network.

    Try accessing the share using \\192.168.x.x\Shared in Windows File Explorer.

    Check for network visibility by pinging the Linux device from Windows.

    Ensure that Windows Firewall allows File and Printer Sharing.

    Ensure SMBv1 is enabled if necessary, but prefer SMBv2/SMBv3.

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the "File not found" error and successfully access your shared folder from Windows. Let me know if the issue persists!
